        "description": "Lightning caused fires are notable as they can be a double edge sword in terms of their benefits to the natural habitat and its unexpected occurrence. These fires can help clear unwanted foliage and can often be contained to a specific area by natural barriers. Lightning begins to form as a result of static charges in rain clouds. As winds reach a certain speed in the atmosphere it causes clouds that are inside it be chaotic and less controlled. The water droplets at the bottom of the cloud are then lifted to the top and freeze over because of the colder atmosphere. At this point electrons are stripped off due to the cloud now pushing the ice/hail from the top. This results in a polar balance of a cloud with a positively charged top and negatively charged bottom. When the fields become strong enough it causes the atmosphere to become an insulator to the point where it overpowers the atmosphere leading to a lightning being formed.",
